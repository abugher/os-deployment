# Opposite day:  A value of "false" for openssh-server/permit-root-login yields
# a value of "yes" for PermitRootLogin in sshd_config.

# debconf settings for openssh-server are ignored at package installation unless early_command and
# late_command include an override.

# Only one late_command line is allowed.  Use semicolons if multiple
# commands are needed.
