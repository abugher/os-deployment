## mksd

    bin/mksd <hostname>

# Bugs:

I had some fun using file descriptors to establish debugging levels, but the
way I did it really made most of this code look awful.  I need to get rid of that.

Right now there are three related lists used to mask systemd services:
* Files to remove.
* Directories to create.
* Files to symlink to /dev/null.
Two problems, here.
1.  The code should be changed to automatically remove files destined for null-linking, so that the remove and symlink lists can be deduplicated.
2.  These lists should be broken down and distributed to the appropriate platform-specific vars files, instead of assuming they all need to be handled all the time.
